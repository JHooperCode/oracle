## The Oracle
A simple chatbot designed to interface with a desired Ollama hosted local LLM model.

## Usage
Eventually the Oracle will be designed to run as a self-hosted docker image providing
a remote API service on which a web-based interface can be accessed.  For now, simply
run bot_base.py as the main file:
    python oracle.py

A basic chat loop is implemented.  You can enter 'goodbye' to quit.
